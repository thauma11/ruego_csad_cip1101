        <blockquote>
            <p style = "font-family:Poppins,Tahoma,Verdana,Sedoe ;font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; text-align:justify; margin:20px; color: #004643;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGrowing up, my childhood was marked by frequent moves and a somewhat blurry early memory.<sup>1</sup> Despite the challenges I faced, I was able to persevere and find the courage to stand up for myself.<sup>2</sup> I was born in Manila where I spent my first two years of school at Cecilio Apostol Elementary School, where I developed a love for learning and knowledge.<sup>3</sup> However, when I was in 2nd grade, my parents went through a difficult separation and we had to move to Quezon City.<sup>4</sup> I continued my education at Tandang Sora Elementary School, where I spent grades 3 to 6.<sup>5</sup></p>
        
            <p style = "font-family:Poppins,Tahoma,Verdana,Sedoe ;font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; text-align:justify; margin:20px; color: #004643;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was during this time that I faced physical bullying from some of my classmates, which was a difficult and trying experience for me.<sup>6</sup> I had to learn how to stand up for myself, to be strong in the face of adversity.<sup>7</sup> Despite these challenges, I refused to let the bullies get the best of me and instead channeled my energy into my studies and new interests.<sup>8</sup> In 5th grade, I discovered my love for music and started playing the guitar.<sup>9</sup> This newfound passion for music became an outlet for me to express myself and a way to find solace during difficult times.<sup>10</sup> I was also an avid player of Legos and had a passion for computer games, which were my ways of coping with difficult situations.<sup>11</sup></p>
            
            <p style = "font-family:Poppins,Tahoma,Verdana,Sedoe ;font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; text-align:justify; margin:20px; color: #004643;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy determination to do well in school and to show my bullies that I was more than just a target for their ridicule paid off when I graduated with honors in elementary school, showcasing my strength and resilience.<sup>12</sup> My childhood experiences taught me the value of hard work, perseverance, and determination, and these are lessons that have stayed with me all throughout my growing up years.<sup>13</sup> I have learned that it's not about avoiding challenges, but about how we choose to face them.<sup>14</sup> By focusing on our passions and interests, we can find the courage to overcome any obstacle.<sup>15</sup> These valuable lessons have shaped who I am today and have allowed me to navigate life's challenges with confidence and grace.<sup>16</sup></p>   

            <p style = "font-family:Poppins,Tahoma,Verdana,Sedoe ;font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; text-align:justify; margin:20px; color: #004643;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThroughout my life, I have also learned to value education and knowledge. I believe that education is the key to success and to living a fulfilling life.<sup>17</sup> I have taken this belief to heart and have made it my mission to continue learning and growing in all areas of my life.<sup>18</sup> I believe that by doing so, I will be better equipped to face life's challenges and to make a positive impact in the world.<sup>19</sup> And this is something that I will always hold dear and carry with me throughout my journey.<sup>20</sup></p>

            <p style = "font-family:Poppins,Tahoma,Verdana,Sedoe ;font-size:16px; line-height:1.5; text-align:justify; margin:20px; color: #004643;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, I remained dedicated to my studies and continued to pursue my passion for music by writing and composing songs in my free time.<sup>18</sup> I was grateful for the time to reflect and explore my creativity, and I was proud of the songs I created.<sup>19</sup> I am proud to say that I graduated with honors from my senior high school, a testament to my hard work and determination.<sup>20</sup></p>
